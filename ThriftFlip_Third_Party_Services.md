## Why Two Separate Services?

### Transparency and Control

**Benefits to You:**

**1. Pay Only for What You Use**
- Light user: ~$0.02/month for Grok
- Heavy user: ~$0.10/month for Grok
- No markup from us

**2. No Hidden Costs**
- Clear separation
- Two bills, two companies
- You control both

**3. Flexibility**
- Use barcode scanner without Grok (free)
- Add Grok only if you want AI features
- Remove Grok anytime

**4. Cost Efficiency**
- Traditional apps: $20-50/month all-inclusive (you pay even if you don't use it)
- ThriftFlip: $9.99/month + ~$0.03/month Grok = ~$10.02/month (pay for actual usage)

---

## Detailed Cost Breakdown

### Scenario 1: Light User (50 scans/month)

**ThriftFlip PRO:**
- Monthly: $9.99
- Annual: $99.99/year = $8.33/month

**Grok API (if using AI):**
- 50 scans × $0.00036 = $0.018/month

**Total Monthly Cost:**
- With monthly plan: $9.99 + $0.02 = **$10.01**
- With annual plan: $8.33 + $0.02 = **$8.35**

---

### Scenario 2: Moderate User (150 scans/month)

**ThriftFlip PRO:**
- Monthly: $9.99
- Annual: $8.33/month

**Grok API (if using AI):**
- 150 scans × $0.00036 = $0.054/month

**Total Monthly Cost:**
- With monthly plan: $9.99 + $0.05 = **$10.04**
- With annual plan: $8.33 + $0.05 = **$8.38**

---

### Scenario 3: Heavy User (500 scans/month)

**ThriftFlip PRO:**
- Monthly: $9.99
- Annual: $8.33/month

**Grok API (if using AI):**
- 500 scans × $0.00036 = $0.18/month

**Total Monthly Cost:**
- With monthly plan: $9.99 + $0.18 = **$10.17**
- With annual plan: $8.33 + $0.18 = **$8.51**
