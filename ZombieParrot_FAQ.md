## Technical Questions

### Why do I need an API key?

Zombie Parrot uses the xAI Grok API to generate code. The API key authenticates your requests and allows you to use the service. Your key is stored securely and never shared.

### What if I hit the query limit?

Free tier users are limited to 10 queries per day. To get unlimited queries:
- Upgrade to Pro subscription
- Wait until the next day (limit resets daily)

### Why is my code generation slow?

Code generation speed depends on:
- Internet connection speed
- xAI API response time
- Complexity of your request
- Current API load

Typical response time: 2-5 seconds.

### Can I use Zombie Parrot offline?

Partially. You can:
- View cached results when offline
- Access previously generated code
- But cannot make new API requests

Pro subscribers get enhanced offline caching.

### What AI model does Zombie Parrot use?

Zombie Parrot uses **Grok Code Fast 1** from xAI, which is specifically designed for coding applications with rapid reasoning for agentic coding tasks.
