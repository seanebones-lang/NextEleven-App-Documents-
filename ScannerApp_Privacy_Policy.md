## Introduction

**Scanner App by NextEleven** ("we," "our," or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application (the "App").

## Information We Collect

  - All X integration is entirely optional and can be disabled at any time

## How We Use Your Information

We use your information solely to:

- Manage your subscriptions and provide premium features
- Improve app functionality and user experience
- Generate analytics and insights about your spending
- Facilitate social expense sharing via X (Twitter) when you explicitly enable and authorize this feature

## Data Storage and Processing

### On-Device Processing
- **100% On-Device AI**: All AI categorization and analysis occurs entirely on your device when using Apple Intelligence
- **Cloud Processing (Optional)**: When you provide your own Grok API key, receipt data is sent to xAI's servers for OCR and analysis
- **No Third-Party Services (Default)**: By default, we do not send your receipt data to any external AI services or third-party processors

### Data Storage
- **Local Storage**: Receipt and document data is stored locally on your device using SwiftData
- **iCloud Sync (Optional)**: If enabled, data syncs across your devices using Apple's CloudKit service

## Data Sharing

We do **NOT**:
- Sell your data to third parties
- Share your receipt information with advertisers
- Use third-party analytics services
- Track you across other apps or websites
- Share data with data brokers

### Apple Services
- **StoreKit 2**: Subscription purchases are processed by Apple. We receive only subscription status information.
- **CloudKit**: If enabled, data syncs through Apple's CloudKit service, which is encrypted and private.

### Optional Third-Party Services
- **Grok AI (xAI)**: When using AI features with your own API key, receipt data is sent to xAI's servers for OCR and analysis. This is entirely user-funded and controlled. See xAI's privacy policy at https://x.ai/privacy
- **X (Twitter)**: When enabled, the app uses X APIs to post summaries and send DMs. You explicitly authorize each action. All X data handling follows X's privacy policy at https://twitter.com/privacy
